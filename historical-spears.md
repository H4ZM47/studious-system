Here are five historically significant spear types representing different cultures, eras, and tactical doctrines:

-----

## 1. Pilum (Roman)

A heavy javelin used by Roman legionaries from roughly 300 BCE to 300 CE. The pilum was generally about 2 meters long overall, consisting of an iron shank about 7mm in diameter and 600mm long with a pyramidal head, attached to a wooden shaft.  Its design was specifically engineered to bend on impact, making it impossible to remove from shields and preventing enemies from throwing it back.

## 2. Dory (Greek)

The primary weapon of the Greek hoplite, used in the famous phalanx formation. The dory was about 2–3 meters in length and had a handle with a diameter of 5 cm made of wood, either cornel or ash, weighing 0.91 to 1.81 kg. The flat leaf-shaped spearhead was composed of iron and its weight was counterbalanced by an iron butt-spike.  The rear spike (sauroter) served as a counterweight, backup weapon, and tool for dispatching fallen enemies.

## 3. Assegai (African)

A throwing spear used extensively across sub-Saharan Africa, most famously by Zulu warriors. The assegai is a polearm used for throwing, usually a light spear or javelin made up of a wooden handle with an iron tip. The use of various types of the assegai was widespread all over Africa and it was the most common weapon used before the introduction of firearms.  King Shaka later developed the shorter *iklwa* stabbing spear as a complement for close combat.

## 4. Yari (Japanese)

The straight-bladed spear that became the dominant battlefield weapon in feudal Japan during the Sengoku period. Yari is the term for a traditionally-made Japanese blade in the form of a spear. Around the latter half of the 16th century, ashigaru holding pikes (nagae yari) with length of 4.5 to 6.5 meters became the main forces in armies.  Yari blades were forged from the same tamahagane steel as katanas and came in numerous configurations including cross-bladed variants.

## 5. Pike (European)

The extremely long thrusting spear that dominated European infantry warfare from the 14th through 17th centuries. The pike was particularly well known as the primary weapon of Spanish tercios, Swiss mercenaries, German Landsknecht units and French sans-culottes.  Ranging from 3 to 7.5 meters in length, pikes were used in dense square formations that proved devastating against cavalry and opposing infantry alike until the development of the bayonet rendered them obsolete.

These five represent a good cross-section of design philosophies: the pilum optimized for a single devastating throw, the dory balanced for phalanx thrusting, the assegai designed for rapid throwing followed by melee, the yari reflecting Japanese bladesmithing traditions, and the pike maximizing reach in massed formations. Any of these could serve as inspiration for competition spear designs, though the dory and assegai are probably closest to your competition parameters given their intermediate length and dual-purpose capability.
