The following is a curated selection of historically significant spear types representing different cultures, eras, and tactical doctrines.

## 1. Pilum (Roman)

A heavy javelin used by Roman legionaries from roughly 300 BCE to 300 CE. The pilum was generally about 2 meters long overall, consisting of an iron shank about 7mm in diameter and 600mm long with a pyramidal head, attached to a wooden shaft.  Its design was specifically engineered to bend on impact, making it impossible to remove from shields and preventing enemies from throwing it back.

## 2. Dory (Greek)

The primary weapon of the Greek hoplite, used in the famous phalanx formation. The dory was about 2–3 meters in length and had a handle with a diameter of 5 cm made of wood, either cornel or ash, weighing 0.91 to 1.81 kg. The flat leaf-shaped spearhead was composed of iron and its weight was counterbalanced by an iron butt-spike.  The rear spike (sauroter) served as a counterweight, backup weapon, and tool for dispatching fallen enemies.

## 3. Assegai (African)

A throwing spear used extensively across sub-Saharan Africa, most famously by Zulu warriors. The assegai is a polearm used for throwing, usually a light spear or javelin made up of a wooden handle with an iron tip. The use of various types of the assegai was widespread all over Africa and it was the most common weapon used before the introduction of firearms.  King Shaka later developed the shorter *iklwa* stabbing spear as a complement for close combat.

## 4. Yari (Japanese)

The straight-bladed spear that became the dominant battlefield weapon in feudal Japan during the Sengoku period. Yari is the term for a traditionally-made Japanese blade in the form of a spear. Around the latter half of the 16th century, ashigaru holding pikes (nagae yari) with length of 4.5 to 6.5 meters became the main forces in armies.  Yari blades were forged from the same tamahagane steel as katanas and came in numerous configurations including cross-bladed variants.

## 5. Pike (European)

The extremely long thrusting spear that dominated European infantry warfare from the 14th through 17th centuries. The pike was particularly well known as the primary weapon of Spanish tercios, Swiss mercenaries, German Landsknecht units and French sans-culottes.  Ranging from 3 to 7.5 meters in length, pikes were used in dense square formations that proved devastating against cavalry and opposing infantry alike until the development of the bayonet rendered them obsolete.

These five represent a cross-section of design philosophies: the pilum optimized for a single devastating throw, the dory balanced for phalanx thrusting, the assegai designed for rapid throwing followed by melee, the yari reflecting Japanese bladesmithing traditions, and the pike maximizing reach in massed formations. Any of these can serve as inspiration for competition spear designs. The dory and assegai are particularly relevant given their intermediate length and dual-purpose capability.

## 6. Sarissa (Macedonian)

The extraordinarily long pike that enabled Alexander the Great's conquests. Each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa, a double-pointed pike over 6 meters (18 ft) in length. Modern reconstructions have shown that a 5.8 meter pike could weigh no more than 4.05 kg.  The sarissa required two hands to wield, forcing soldiers to use a smaller shield suspended from the neck. Its extreme length meant the first five ranks could project their spear points beyond the front line simultaneously.

## 7. Qiang (Chinese)

The Chinese spear, known as "The King of Weapons" in martial arts tradition. Due to its relative ease of manufacture, the spear in many variations was ubiquitous on the pre-modern Chinese battlefield. It is known as one of the four major weapons, along with the gun (staff), dao (sabre), and the jian (straight sword).  Common features of the Chinese spear are the leaf-shaped blade and red horse-hair tassel lashed just below. The tassel aids in blurring the vision of the opponent so that it is more difficult for them to grab the shaft of spear behind the head or tip.

## 8. Boar Spear (European)

A specialized hunting spear with a distinctive crossbar design. Boar spears are relatively short and heavy, with two "lugs" or "wings" on the spearsocket behind the blade, which act as a barrier to prevent the spear from penetrating too deeply into the quarry where it might get stuck or break, and to stop an injured and furious boar from working its way up the shaft of the spear to attack the hunter.  The crossbar design was later adapted for military use, as it prevented over-penetration and made weapon withdrawal faster.

## 9. Angon (Frankish/Germanic)

An early medieval barbed javelin descended from the Roman pilum. The angon was a type of javelin that was used during the Early Middle Ages by the Anglo-Saxons, Franks, Goths, and other Germanic peoples. It was similar to, and probably derived from, the pilum used by the Roman army and had a barbed head and long narrow socket or shank made of iron mounted on a wooden haft.  The barbed head and iron-sheathed shaft made it impossible to remove from shields or pull out of wounds, forcing enemies to discard their protection.

## 10. Hasta (Roman)

The Roman thrusting spear that predated the pilum and gave the *hastati* infantry their name. In later republican times, the hastati were re-armed with pila and gladii, and the hasta was only retained by the triarii. Unlike the pilum, verutum and lancea, the hasta was not thrown, but used for thrusting.  Triarii were armed with spears, or hastae, about 2 metres (6½ feet) long. They also carried swords, or gladii, about 84 centimetres (29 inches) long, in case the spear broke or the enemy drew too close.  The hasta represented Rome's earlier hoplite-style tactics before they developed their distinctive sword-and-javelin system.

-----

These five add useful variety to the earlier examples: the sarissa represents the extreme-length formation pike, the qiang shows Asian martial arts integration, the boar spear introduces purpose-built hunting design with the crossbar feature, the angon demonstrates barbed anti-shield tactics, and the hasta shows a balanced thrusting design. For maker competitions, the boar spear's crossbar concept and the qiang's tassel are particularly notable design elements that competitors may find worth adapting.
