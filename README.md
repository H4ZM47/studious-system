## Five Additional Competition Events

**Throwing Events**

1. **Moving Target Intercept** — A foam target on a zipline or pendulum crosses the throwing lane at ~5 m/s. Competitor gets five attempts to strike the target. Scored on hits (2 points) and near-misses within 30cm (1 point). Tests predictive aim and release timing.
1. **Speed Accuracy Drill** — Five targets at 12m distance in a 3m-wide arc. Competitor retrieves and throws as many times as possible in 90 seconds. Each hit scores 2 points; each miss deducts 1 point. Tests handling speed and consistent accuracy under fatigue.

**Non-Throwing Events**

1. **Thrust Repetition Test** — Competitor executes 20 controlled thrusts into a standardized target (layered foam with fabric facing) as quickly as possible. Scored on time to completion, with 2-second penalties for thrusts that miss the 15cm target zone. Tests point durability, shaft ergonomics, and grip security.
1. **Braced Impact Resistance** — Spear braced at 45° angle against a fixed stop, butt grounded. A 15kg pendulum released from 1.5m arc height strikes the shaft 40cm behind the point. Three impacts; spear inspected after each. Scored on structural integrity (no visible damage = 10pts, cosmetic damage = 6pts, functional damage = 2pts, failure = 0pts). Tests shaft strength in compression and point-to-shaft joint integrity.
1. **Obstacle Maneuver Course** — Timed course requiring the competitor to carry the spear through doorways, around pylons, over/under barriers, and execute three designated thrust-and-withdraw motions into targets. 5-second penalties for dropped spear, struck obstacles, or missed targets. Tests overall balance, length practicality, and handling characteristics.

-----

## Section 3: Budget Constraints

### 3.1 Material Cost Cap

Total material expenditure: **$75.00 USD maximum**

### 3.2 What Counts Toward Budget

- All raw materials incorporated into finished spear
- Partial material usage: cost = (amount used ÷ amount purchased) × purchase price
- Gifted materials: fair market value (provide comparable retail pricing)
- Scrap/reclaimed materials: $0 if sourced from personal stock or free; otherwise actual acquisition cost

### 3.3 What Does Not Count Toward Budget

- Tools (see Section 4)
- Consumables exhausted during build (sandpaper, drill bits, saw blades, finishing rags)
- Finishing materials (oils, waxes, paints, stains) up to $15 value
- Safety equipment
- Failed prototypes not incorporated into final spear

### 3.4 Documentation Required

Competitors must submit a **Bill of Materials** including:

- Item description
- Supplier name
- Unit cost and quantity purchased
- Quantity/amount used
- Calculated cost applied to budget

Receipts, screenshots, or catalog pricing required for all items over $5. Judges may verify pricing; intentional underreporting results in disqualification.

-----

## Section 4: Tools

### 4.1 Permitted Tools — No Restrictions

Competitors may use any hand tools, power tools, or machinery to which they have legitimate access. This includes but is not limited to:

- Hand saws, planes, chisels, drawknives, spokeshaves
- Power sanders, drills, lathes, band saws, table saws
- Forges, anvils, hammers, swage blocks, grinders (for metalwork)
- Kilns, torches (for heat treatment)
- Knapping tools (antler billets, pressure flakers, abrasion stones)
- CNC routers, laser cutters, 3D printers (for jigs/fixtures only — see 4.2)

### 4.2 Additive Manufacturing Restriction

3D-printed, laser-sintered, or CNC-machined components may **not** be incorporated into the finished spear. These technologies may be used for:

- Jigs, fixtures, and templates
- Molds for casting (if casting permitted materials)
- Prototyping (prototype components may not be used in competition spear)

### 4.3 Tool Borrowing/Rental

Permitted. Tool access is not a scored component. Budget-conscious competitors with limited shop access are not penalized.

### 4.4 Commercial Services Prohibition

Competitors may not commission third parties to fabricate components. All work must be performed by the registered competitor. Exceptions:

- Basic material processing by supplier (e.g., rough lumber milling, steel bar cutting to length)
- Heat treatment services if competitor lacks equipment (must be documented)

-----

## Section 5: Construction Requirements

### 5.1 Builder Eligibility

- Spear must be built entirely by the registered competitor
- Team entries permitted if registered as a team (2-person max); both members must contribute documented work
- Professional spear-makers, bladesmiths, and related tradespeople are eligible but must compete in Open division if divisions are established

### 5.2 Build Documentation

Competitors must submit a **Build Log** containing:

- Minimum 10 photographs documenting construction stages
- Brief descriptions of techniques used
- Timeline (start date, completion date, estimated total hours)

Build logs may be shared publicly at organizer discretion (competitors may opt out of public sharing while still providing to judges).

### 5.3 Construction Timing

**Option A — Pre-Built**: Spears constructed in advance, brought to event. Build log submitted at check-in.

**Option B — Live Build** (if event format includes): All construction occurs within designated build window at event venue. Materials and tools inspected before build period begins.

Organizer specifies which option applies.

### 5.4 Originality

- Designs may be based on historical patterns or original concepts
- Direct copies of another competitor's prior entry are discouraged but not prohibited
- No intellectual property restrictions on historical or traditional designs

-----

## Section 6: Inspection and Compliance

### 6.1 Pre-Competition Inspection

All spears undergo inspection before competition begins. Inspection verifies:

- Dimensional compliance (length, diameter, weight, point geometry)
- Material compliance (visual inspection; competitors may be asked to identify materials)
- Tip radius (go/no-go gauge)
- Edge sharpness (paper test)
- Flex test
- Budget documentation review

### 6.2 Inspection Outcomes

- **Pass**: Spear admitted to competition
- **Conditional Pass**: Minor non-compliance that can be corrected on-site (e.g., tip radius too sharp — may be filed down; slight overweight — may remove material). 30-minute correction window.
- **Fail**: Non-compliance that cannot be corrected or competitor declines correction. Spear may not compete. Competitor may participate in non-scored exhibition if desired.

### 6.3 Inspection Appeals

Competitor may request secondary inspection by a different judge. Secondary decision is final.

### 6.4 Mid-Competition Inspection

Judges may re-inspect spears between events if damage is suspected of creating safety hazard or non-compliance. Judges may require field repair or withdraw spear from further competition.

-----

## Section 7: Competition Rules

### 7.1 Single Spear Rule

Each competitor competes with **one spear** across all events. No substitutions, spare spears, or component swaps permitted after initial inspection.

### 7.2 Field Repairs

Between events, competitors may perform field repairs. Constraints:

- **Time limit**: 10 minutes maximum between events
- **Materials**: Only materials and adhesives brought by competitor; consumables (tape, cord, glue) available from organizer supply table for emergencies
- **Tool limit**: Hand tools only; no power tools during repair windows
- **Scope**: Binding repair, re-seating loose points, crack stabilization. Structural shaft replacement is not possible (you have one shaft).

Repairs during events are not permitted. If spear fails during an event, competitor scores zero for remaining attempts in that event and may repair before the next event.

### 7.3 Catastrophic Failure

If the spear is damaged beyond functional repair (shaft break, point separation not repairable in time window), competitor scores zero for all remaining events but retains scores from completed events.

### 7.4 Event Order

Events are conducted in the following order (least to most destructive):

1. Obstacle Maneuver Course
1. Accuracy Challenge
1. Moving Target Intercept
1. Distance Throw
1. Speed Accuracy Drill
1. Thrust Repetition Test
1. Penetration Test
1. Braced Impact Resistance
1. Static Load Test
1. Durability Gauntlet

Organizer may select a subset of events; order should preserve least-to-most-destructive sequencing.

### 7.5 Throwing Procedure

- Competitor stands behind designated line; any part of foot on or over line at release invalidates throw
- Javelin-style release (overhand, release at or above shoulder level); no underhand, sidearm, or overhead harpoon-style throws
- Competitor may use run-up if run-up lane is provided; approach may not exceed 15m
- Range officer issues commands: "RANGE CLEAR — READY — THROW"
- Spear must be released on "THROW" or within 5 seconds after; failure to release = attempt forfeited
- Competitor may not retrieve spear until range officer announces "RANGE SAFE — RETRIEVE"

### 7.6 Non-Throwing Procedure

- Event-specific procedures provided in event descriptions
- Competitor receives briefing and may ask clarifying questions before each event
- Practice attempts may be offered at organizer discretion (not scored)

### 7.7 Scoring

Each event has a defined scoring rubric. Scores are normalized as follows:

- Best performance in each event = 100 points
- All other scores = (competitor performance ÷ best performance) × 100

Final score = sum of normalized scores across all events. Highest total score wins.

Ties are broken by:

1. Greater number of event wins
1. Higher score in Durability Gauntlet
1. Lower spear weight (rewards efficiency)
1. Coin flip if still tied

### 7.8 Competitor Conduct

- Competitors may observe other competitors' attempts
- No coaching or assistance during an attempt; between attempts, discussion is permitted
- Unsportsmanlike conduct (sabotage, interference, harassment) results in immediate disqualification
- Competitors are responsible for their own safety and the safety of spectators within their control
